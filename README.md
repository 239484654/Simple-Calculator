# Simple Calculator for Windows

## Introduction
This calculator is a simple desktop application designed to provide users with basic calculation functions. It draws on the design concepts and ideas of some open - source projects and features simplicity and ease of use.

[Chinese version](./README_zhs.md)

## Function Overview
This calculator has the following main functions:
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Decimal Handling**: Can handle the input and calculation of numbers containing decimal points.
3. **Number Input**: Users can input numbers by clicking the number buttons on the interface.
4. **Clear Operations**: Provides functions to clear all inputs, clear the current input, and delete the last digit.
5. **System Color Adaptation**: Can automatically adjust the interface color according to the system's theme color (dark or light).

## Interface Description

### Color Mode
The calculator will automatically switch the interface color according to the system's color theme. If the system is in dark mode, the calculator will use a dark color scheme; if it is in light mode, it will use a light color scheme. If the `darkdetect` library is not installed on the system, the calculator will default to the light mode.

### Display Area
- **Current Display**: Used to show the numbers input by the user and the calculation results. The maximum display length is 10 digits.

### Button Area
- **Number Buttons**: From 0 to 9, used to input numbers.
- **Decimal Point Button**: Used to input decimal points.
- **Operator Buttons**: Include operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร), and division (รท) for mathematical operations.
- **Clear Buttons**:
  - **Clear All**: Clears all inputs and calculation results, resetting the display area to 0.
  - **Clear Current**: Clears the currently input number.
  - **Delete One**: Deletes the last digit in the display area.

## Usage Instructions

### Number Input
Click the number buttons (0 - 9) to input numbers. If you need to input a decimal, click the decimal point button.

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
After inputting the first number, click an operator button to select the operation to be performed. Then input the second number and finally click the equal sign (=) button to perform the calculation. The calculation result will be displayed in the display area.

### Clear Operations
- To clear all inputs and calculation results, click the "Clear All" button.
- To clear only the currently input number, click the "Clear Current" button.
- To delete the last digit in the display area, click the "Delete One" button.

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
This calculator uses the following Python libraries:
- `math`: For mathematical calculations.
- `tkinter`: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- `cmath`: For complex number calculations.
- `fractions`: For fraction processing.
- `decimal`: For high - precision decimal calculations.
- `threading`: For starting a thread to check the system color.
- `time`: For time - related operations.
- `darkdetect`: For detecting the system's color theme (dark or light).

### Code Structure
- `add_fraction`: Handles the addition operation of fractions.
- `calculate_expression`: Calculates the input expression.
- `Int`: Performs integer conversion.
- `pressNumber`: Handles the click events of number buttons.
- `pressDP`: Handles the click event of the decimal point button.
- `clearAll`: Clears all inputs and calculation results.
- `clearCurrent`: Clears the currently input number.
- `delOne`: Deletes the last digit in the display area.
- `pressOperator`: Handles the click events of operator buttons.
- `Demo`: Used for demonstration.
- `check_system_color`: Starts a thread to check the system's color theme and adjusts the interface color accordingly.
